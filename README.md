# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

ðŸ“Š Portfolio Projects Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository contains various data analysis projects where I have worked with SQL, Python, Excel, and Power Bi and Tableau to clean, analyze, and visualize data.

ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview

1> Bike Sales Dashboard (Bike Sales Dashboard.xlsx) 

Tools: Microsoft Excel
Description: Created a dashboard to analyze bike sales trends, customer demographics, and revenue performance.

2> COVID Portfolio Project (COVID Portfolio Project.sql) 

Description: The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

Skills: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

Technology: SQL Server

3> Customer Analysis (Customer Analysis.twb)

Tools: Tableau
Description: Interactive Tableau visualization to analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.

4> Data Cleaning in Pandas (Data cleaning in pandas.ipynb)

Tools: Python (Pandas)
Description: Cleaned messy datasets using Pandas by handling missing values, duplicates, and standardizing formats.

5> Music Store Database Analysis (music_store_project.sql) 
Tools: SQL
Description: Queried a music store database to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and artist popularity.

6> Music Store Data Schema (MusicDatabaseSchema.png) 
Tools: Entity-Relationship Diagram
Description: Schema representation of the music store database, showing relationships between tables.

7> Vrinda Store Data Analysis (Vrinda Store Data Analysis.xlsx)
Vrinda-Store-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
Project Objective
The Vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, the owner of the Vrinda store can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023.

Dataset used
Vrinda Store Data
Questions (KPIs)
Compare the sales and orders using single chart.
Which month got the highest sales and orders?
Who purchased more - Men or Women?
What are different order status in 2022?
List top 10 states contributingto the sales?
Relation between age and gender based on number of orders.
Which Channel is contributing maximum to the sales?
Highest selling category?
Process
Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dashboard interactive and dynamic.

Project Insight
Women customers are more likely to buy products compared to men (~65%).
The states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 product buyers.
The adult age group (30-49 yrs) is max contributing (~50%) and buys the most products.
The maximum number of products customer orders from Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels.
Final Conclusion:
To improve sales of Vrinda Store, women customers of the age group (30-49 yrs) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh must be targeted by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.

8>Exploratory Data Analysis on World Population

Description:
This project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a world population dataset, focusing on key metrics such as total population, density, and growth trends. The dataset is cleaned, formatted, and visualized to uncover insights into global population distribution.

Tools Used:

Python for data analysis
Pandas for data cleaning & manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration

Key Analysis Steps:
Loading & Inspecting Data: Read the dataset and perform an initial exploration of columns and data types.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, adjusting numerical formats, and setting float precision.
Statistical Analysis: Calculating mean population, density distributions, and ranking countries.
Visualizations:

Bar charts & Histograms for population trends

Scatter plots for population vs. area comparison

Heatmaps for correlation analysis

Insights Gained:
Identified the most and least populated countries

Analyzed population density trends across regions

Explored growth patterns over time

8>Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie

Code: Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb

Goal: To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

Description: The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

Results: Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.
