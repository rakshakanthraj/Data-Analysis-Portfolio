# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

ðŸ“Š Portfolio Projects Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository contains various data analysis projects where I have worked with SQL, Python, Excel, and Power Bi and Tableau to clean, analyze, and visualize data.

ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview

1> Bike Sales Dashboard (Bike Sales Dashboard.xlsx) 

Tools: Microsoft Excel
Description: Created a dashboard to analyze bike sales trends, customer demographics, and revenue performance.

2> COVID Portfolio Project (COVID Portfolio Project.sql) 

Description: The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

Skills: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

Technology: SQL Server

3> Customer Analysis (Customer Analysis.twb)

Tools: Tableau
Description: Interactive Tableau visualization to analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior. 
Tableau Project : https://public.tableau.com/views/CustomerAnalysis_17376237788820/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

4> Data Cleaning in Pandas (Data cleaning in pandas.ipynb)

Tools: Python (Pandas)
Description: Cleaned messy datasets using Pandas by handling missing values, duplicates, and standardizing formats.

5> Music Store Database Analysis (music_store_project.sql) 
Tools: SQL
Description: Queried a music store database to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and artist popularity.

6> Music Store Data Schema (MusicDatabaseSchema.png) 
Tools: Entity-Relationship Diagram
Description: Schema representation of the music store database, showing relationships between tables.

7> Vrinda Store Data Analysis (Vrinda Store Data Analysis.xlsx)
Tools: Excel
Description: Sales and inventory analysis for Vrinda Store using Excel functions and pivot tables.

8>Exploratory Data Analysis on World Population

Description:
This project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a world population dataset, focusing on key metrics such as total population, density, and growth trends. The dataset is cleaned, formatted, and visualized to uncover insights into global population distribution.

Tools Used:

Python for data analysis
Pandas for data cleaning & manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration

Key Analysis Steps:
Loading & Inspecting Data: Read the dataset and perform an initial exploration of columns and data types.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, adjusting numerical formats, and setting float precision.
Statistical Analysis: Calculating mean population, density distributions, and ranking countries.
Visualizations:

Bar charts & Histograms for population trends

Scatter plots for population vs. area comparison

Heatmaps for correlation analysis

Insights Gained:
Identified the most and least populated countries

Analyzed population density trends across regions

Explored growth patterns over time

8>Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie

Code: Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb

Goal: To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

Description: The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

Results: Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.
